# Project Source Code
This section contains the source code for the program explained in my dissertation. The program no longer functions as it used the Reading Buses Open Data API which has since been turned off. However, a new API could be integrated into the program with ease. The program was written using Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise and uses C# .NET 5 WPF.
